Face Recognition using - i) Haar Cascade Classifier in OpenCV ii) MTCNN library that makes use of three neural networks to recognize faces. The code detects faces in pictures.


The code is in python3 and is written in .py files.


Required libraries: matplotlib, mtcnn, cv2.


Files included:

1. Cascade_CV2.py

Change dir to present working directory and even the image directory.

Makes use of the included haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml and OpenCV to recognize faces and draw boxes over them.

2. MTCNN.py

Change dir to present working directory and even the image directory.

Makes use of the MTCNN library that needs to be installed using - sudo pip3 install MTCNN.
